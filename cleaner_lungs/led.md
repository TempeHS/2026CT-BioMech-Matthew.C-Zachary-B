# LED

### Started work on setting up led. If either the air quality sensor or the dust sensor detects any dust/bad air quality, the led will start flashing.

----------------------------------
### Moved LED to pin 3, this allows the cables to be less close together when they are all plugged in.
### The source file is giving an error of "too many arguments to function 'bool led()".

----------------------------------
### LED code needs to be fixed up to get the led to flash, as right now it will just turn the led on and never off
