Link for air quality library:
https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/Grove_Air_quality_Sensor
Version 1.0.2

Base code from:
https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Air_Quality_Sensor_v1.3/

The Air Quality sensor will be on pin A0.

I believe the setup prints " waiting to init..", until it has initiated, then if it has not after 20 seconds, then it prints "Sensor error"

Finished serial monitor setup
Tried to run the code on an arduino board
First computer had an issue where it would not detect the port
Second computer has an issue where the upload does not work, as it appears that arduino cannot communicate properly with the computer to upload
