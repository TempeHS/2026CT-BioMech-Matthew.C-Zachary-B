Link for air quality library:
https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/Grove_Air_quality_Sensor
Version 1.0.2

Base code from:
https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Air_Quality_Sensor_v1.3/

The Air Quality sensor will be on pin A0.

I believe the setup prints " waiting to init..", until it has initiated, then if it has not after 20 seconds, then it prints "Sensor error"
