# Cleaner, Lighter Lungs

### This project is being created for our patient Mohey, it will be used to detect air particles that may damage his lungs. As he wants to continue working on construction sites, this project seeks to allow him to return to work whilst still aiding him in avoiding irreversible damage to his lungs. We will be creating a system that can detect dust and other air particles that may harm his lungs through the use of a dust and air quality sensor along with alerts to tell Mohey when he is near those air particles.
